## GitHub Actions

This repo uses github actions to automate deployment. 

The pull requests will start testing my software as someone requests it. 

This triggers a workflow that goes through the YML configuration file. 

In this repo a simple hello world file and the action.yml file and triggers the Dockerfile.
